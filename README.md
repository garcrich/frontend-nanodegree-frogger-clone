###Project 3 of Udacity Nano Degree

The objective of this project was to teach students how to use object-oriented programming using JavaScript's unique syntax. Main topics included classes, instances, inheritance, and delegation.

A pre-existing game engine was provided. All student contributions were done directly in the app.js file. 


####How to Play

Players can use a keyboard's directional keys to move the player. Once the player reaches the water the game will reset.
